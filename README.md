# VirusBroadcast

A simulation program based on Java. Due to the rush of time and insufficient data, the model and deduction process are too simple. If you have good ideas or can provide relevant data support, please raise issues.

If you are also a Java programmer, you can directly modify and submit PR to me. I hope to have the opportunity to do a review through these accurate data.

2024.12.6:
The virus mutation process is a process of continuous adaptation. You can try a simple DNN to model the virus, and it has begun to be implemented.

2020.12.31:
The amount of data is too small and the simulation results are too unreliable. DNN is temporarily shelved.
